# Keras-FRCNN For Object Detection in Satelite Images (SIMD Dataset)
Faster-RCNN: Detection of Objects in aerial images in the SIMD dataset. The code can be used to detect objects in your own aerial images with the model that can be downloaded from the given link.

Repo cloned from https://github.com/kbardool/keras-frcnn.

This readme file is as edited version of the one found in the above repo. The original did not have instruction on using the measure_map.py file and I also faced some bugs that have been removed.

USAGE:
- Both theano and tensorflow backends are supported. However compile times are very high in theano, and tensorflow is highly recommended.
- `train_frcnn.py` can be used to train a model. To train on Pascal VOC data, simply do:
`python train_frcnn.py -p /path/to/pascalvoc/`. 
- the Pascal VOC data set (images and annotations for bounding boxes around the classified objects) can be obtained from: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar
- simple_parser.py provides an alternative way to input data, using a text file. Simply provide a text file, with each
line containing:

    `filepath,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name`

    For example:

    /data/imgs/img_001.jpg,837,346,981,456,cow
    
    /data/imgs/img_002.jpg,215,312,279,391,cat

    The classes will be inferred from the file. To use the simple parser instead of the default pascal voc style parser,
    use the command line option `-o simple`. For example `python train_frcnn.py -o simple -p my_data.txt`.

- Running `train_frcnn.py` will write weights to disk to an hdf5 file, as well as all the setting of the training run to a `pickle` file. These
settings can then be loaded by `test_frcnn.py` for any testing.

- measure_mappy can be used to perform evalutation, given wieghts and a config file (already given in this repo. The measure_map.py can be run with the following command if you are using the simple parser:
    `python measure_map.py -o simple -p test.csv` 

- test_frcnn.py can be used to perform inference, given pretrained weights and a config file. Specify a path to the folder containing
images:
    `python test_frcnn.py -p /path/to/test_data/`
- Data augmentation can be applied by specifying `--hf` for horizontal flips, `--vf` for vertical flips and `--rot` for 90 degree rotations

NOTES:
- config.py contains all settings for the train or test run. The default settings match those in the original Faster-RCNN
paper. The anchor box sizes are [128, 256, 512] and the ratios are [1:1, 1:2, 2:1].
- The theano backend by default uses a 7x7 pooling region, instead of 14x14 as in the frcnn paper. This cuts down compiling time slightly.
- The tensorflow backend performs a resize on the pooling region, instead of max pooling. This is much more efficient and has little impact on results.

- This repo was developed using `python2`. `python3` should work thanks to the contribution of a number of users.

- If you run out of memory, try reducing the number of ROIs that are processed simultaneously. Try passing a lower `-n` to `train_frcnn.py`. Alternatively, try reducing the image size from the default value of 600 (this setting is found in `config.py`.
