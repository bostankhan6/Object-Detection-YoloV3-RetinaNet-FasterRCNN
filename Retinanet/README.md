# RetinaNet

[Implementation of Retinanet in Keras by Fizyr](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet)

## Installation

1) Clone this repository.
2) Ensure numpy is installed using `pip install numpy --user`
3) In the repository, execute `pip install . --user`.
   Note that due to inconsistencies with how `tensorflow` should be installed,
   this package does not define a dependency on `tensorflow` as it will try to install that (which at least on Arch Linux results in an incorrect installation).
   Please make sure `tensorflow` is installed as per your systems requirements.
4) Alternatively, you can run the code directly from the cloned  repository, however you need to run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` to compile Cython code first.
5) Optionally, install `pycocotools` if you want to train / test on the MS COCO dataset by running `pip install --user git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI`.

## Testing
An example of testing the network can be seen in [this Notebook](https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/examples/ResNet50RetinaNet.ipynb).
In general, inference of the network works as follows:
```python
boxes, scores, labels = model.predict_on_batch(inputs)
```

Where `boxes` are shaped `(None, None, 4)` (for `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`), scores is shaped `(None, None)` (classification score) and labels is shaped `(None, None)` (label corresponding to the score). In all three outputs, the first dimension represents the shape and the second dimension indexes the list of detections.

Loading models can be done in the following manner:
```python
from keras_retinanet.models import load_model
model = load_model('/path/to/model.h5', backbone_name='resnet50')
```

Execution time on NVIDIA Pascal Titan X is roughly 75msec for an image of shape `1000x800x3`.

### Converting a training model to inference model
The training procedure of `keras-retinanet` works with *training models*. These are stripped down versions compared to the *inference model* and only contains the layers necessary for training (regression and classification values). If you wish to do inference on a model (perform object detection on an image), you need to convert the trained model to an inference model. This is done as follows:

```shell
# Running directly from the repository:
keras_retinanet/bin/convert_model.py /path/to/training/model.h5 /path/to/save/inference/model.h5

# Using the installed script:
retinanet-convert-model /path/to/training/model.h5 /path/to/save/inference/model.h5
```

Most scripts (like `retinanet-evaluate`) also support converting on the fly, using the `--convert-model` argument.


## Training
`keras-retinanet` can be trained using [this](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/bin/train.py) script.
Note that the train script uses relative imports since it is inside the `keras_retinanet` package.
If you want to adjust the script for your own use outside of this repository,
you will need to switch it to use absolute imports.

If you installed `keras-retinanet` correctly, the train script will be installed as `retinanet-train`.
However, if you make local modifications to the `keras-retinanet` repository, you should run the script directly from the repository.
That will ensure that your local changes will be used by the train script.

The default backbone is `resnet50`. You can change this using the `--backbone=xxx` argument in the running script.
`xxx` can be one of the backbones in resnet models (`resnet50`, `resnet101`, `resnet152`), mobilenet models (`mobilenet128_1.0`, `mobilenet128_0.75`, `mobilenet160_1.0`, etc), densenet models or vgg models. The different options are defined by each model in their corresponding python scripts (`resnet.py`, `mobilenet.py`, etc).

Trained models can't be used directly for inference. To convert a trained model to an inference model, check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#converting-a-training-model-to-inference-model).

### Usage

For training on a [custom dataset], a CSV file can be used as a way to pass the data.
See below for more details on the format of these CSV files.
An example of the train.csv and classes.csv has been provided with this repo. An xml_to_csv.py file has been provided for changing xml notations to csv file format. Just plug in the train, validation and test image directories, overall annotation directory and a base target directory for the CSV and run xml_to_csv file.

To train using your CSV, run:
```shell
# Running directly from the repository:
keras_retinanet/bin/train.py csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes

# Using the installed script:
retinanet-train csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes
```

## CSV datasets
The `CSVGenerator` provides an easy way to define your own datasets.
It uses two CSV files: one file containing annotations and one file containing a class name to ID mapping.

### Annotations format
The CSV file with annotations should contain one annotation per line.
Images with multiple bounding boxes should use one row per bounding box.
Note that indexing for pixel values starts at 0.
The expected format of each line is:
```
path/to/image.jpg,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
```
By default the CSV generator will look for images relative to the directory of the annotations file.

Some images may not contain any labeled objects.
To add these images to the dataset as negative examples,
add an annotation where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` and `class_name` are all empty:
```
path/to/image.jpg,,,,,
```

A full example:
```
/data/imgs/img_001.jpg,837,346,981,456,cow
/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,215,312,279,391,cat
/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,22,5,89,84,bird
/data/imgs/img_003.jpg,,,,,
```

This defines a dataset with 3 images.
`img_001.jpg` contains a cow.
`img_002.jpg` contains a cat and a bird.
`img_003.jpg` contains no interesting objects/animals.


### Class mapping format
The class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line.
Each line should use the following format:
```
class_name,id
```

Indexing for classes starts at 0.
Do not include a background class as it is implicit.

For example:
```
cow,0
cat,1
bird,2
```

## Anchor optimization

In some cases, the default anchor configuration is not suitable for detecting objects in your dataset, for example, if your objects are smaller than the 32x32px (size of the smallest anchors). In this case, it might be suitable to modify the anchor configuration, this can be done automatically by following the steps in the [anchor-optimization](https://github.com/martinzlocha/anchor-optimization/) repository. To use the generated configuration check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet-test-data/blob/master/config/config.ini) for an example config file and then pass it to `train.py` using the `--config` parameter.

## Debugging
Creating your own dataset does not always work out of the box. There is a [`debug.py`](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/bin/debug.py) tool to help find the most common mistakes.

Particularly helpful is the `--annotations` flag which displays your annotations on the images from your dataset. Annotations are colored in green when there are anchors available and colored in red when there are no anchors available. If an annotation doesn't have anchors available, it means it won't contribute to training. It is normal for a small amount of annotations to show up in red, but if most or all annotations are red there is cause for concern. The most common issues are that the annotations are too small or too oddly shaped (stretched out).
